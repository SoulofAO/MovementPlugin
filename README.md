# MovementPlugin

This plugin is dedicated to the motion component, which I once developed to move character in my game People Can Fly, but it is significantly upgraded in terms of speed and beauty. 

You can use this plugin, but please note that this plugin is under development, so I waive any responsibility. 
Since there are others interested in his work, I am publishing his primary version. At the moment, it requires significant polishing.
